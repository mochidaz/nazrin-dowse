Touhou Arrangement Music Finder

## What is this?

Nazrin Dowse is a tool that helps you find arranged Touhou music by its original title. It's a simple web application that scrapes the Touhou Wiki to find arranged music of a Touhou song.

## How to use

1. Copy and paste the Touhou Wiki page of the doujin circle whose arranged music you want to search for. For example, if you want to search in Diao ye zong's discography, copy and paste the following link: https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/%E5%87%8B%E5%8F%B6%E6%A3%95
2. Input the original title of the Touhou song you want to find the arranged music for. If the title of the song is in Japanese, input the kanji/hiragana/katakana of the song title. If it contains English characters, you can input those. For example, if you want to find the arranged music for "神さびた古戦場　～ Suwa Foughten Field" (The Venerable Ancient Battlefield ~ Suwa Foughten Field), you can just type "Suwa Foughten Field" in the search bar. But if it's "ネイティブフェイス" (Native Faith), you need to type "ネイティブフェイス" in the search bar.
3. Click on the search button, and you'll get a list of the arranged music for the song you searched for.

When you're using the tools, if you find a misplaced data (For example, instead of the english title of a song, it shows the trumpet player), you can open an issue or make a pull request to fix it. This problem might occur because of the way the Touhou Wiki is structured, and I might have missed some data while scraping the website.
